# Gesture Detection
Hand gesture is a natural way for humans to interact with the computers to perform variety of applications. Deep learning which is efficient for image recognition system is used to find the hand gesture which is captured dynamically. Hand gesture recognition possesses extensive applications in virtual reality’ sign language recognition’ and computer games. The direct interface of hand gestures provides us a new way for communicating with the virtual environment. 

# How does it work?
• Initially the dataset is loaded into the network for training. 

• Preprocessing is done before the feature is extracted. 

• After training an input image is given which is captured by a webcam. 

• The given input image is tested for recognizing the gesture.

• The test is then converted to speech.

# Difficulties
**There maybe be difficulty in detecting the gesture when:**

• There are shadows

• There is background clutter

• The speed of gesture changing

• Snapping "in between" unwanted gestures

• Bad camera angle

• There are unrecognized gestures made.
